I started the project on Friday, but I kept on having problems with git. I had to reinitialize git inside Project1, which I didn't understand at first,
and I didn't want empty directories on the related repo in Github, so I had to also learn to change and delete branches, pull before push, etc.

I continued on Saturday, wherein I actually began creating the code. I am not a graphic designer by any means, so I just wanted to create a very simple
html document that could display my favorite artists. I know that I can find artists using the api, searching by their name, but I figured since
the project allows me to just hardcode their id's in, I decided to go with that for simplicity's sake. 

I created two python files, one that has the function for actually displaying the music, and the one that simply just fetches the data. 

It also turns out that not every song on Spotify actually has a preview_url, so don't expect one for every song.
